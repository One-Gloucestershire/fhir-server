This is not limited to practitioners, but may include other caregivers such as family members, guardians, the individual themselves, or others. The care team, depending on where used, may include care team members specific to a particular care plan, an episode, an encounter, or may reflect all known team members across these perspectives. An individual's care team can be dynamic over time, such that there can be transience of team members, such as a rehabilitation team.","copyright":"Copyright © 2021+ HL7 UK Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
